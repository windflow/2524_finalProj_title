#Author: Muzi Ti

#This project contains two programs(files): (Twifier.py)One is to send notifications as a text message to the user's phone(or multiple #users) via #email(smtp) #server whenever user tweets himself/herself or someone else @ the user(well, you can change it to @anyone like #Obama maybe?); (TwiMonitor.py)The other is a streamer that can display all tweets #flying after it starts listening, and filtering only #tweets related to #user's interests (keywords) but not at the same time. Another file(eventMsger.py) is just used to send text via #email.
